I'm as big a fan of [unsubstantiated anecdotal arguments](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/opinion/sunday/lecture-me-really.html) as anyone but deciding you're not willing to give up lecturing doesn't suddenly make it a quality learning experience.

Molly Worthen almost admits as much herself near the end of the article (emphasis mine):

> Note-taking is important partly for the record it creates, **but letâ€™s be honest. Students forget most of the facts we teach them not long after the final exam, if not sooner.** The real power of good notes lies in how they shape the mind.
