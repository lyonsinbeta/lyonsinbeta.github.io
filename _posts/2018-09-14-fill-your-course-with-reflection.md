It's been a dream of mine to present at [InstructureCon](https://www.canvaslms.com/news/instructurecon/), and after five years and one false start it finally happened! If you want to hear me talk about feedback and reflection in course design while wearing a really awkward t-shirt, check out the video below.

When you're done with that you can [watch all the other amazing presentations](https://www.canvaslms.com/instructurecon/video/2018) too because Instructure posts them all publicly.
