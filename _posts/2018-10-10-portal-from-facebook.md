Facebook, [a company whose name is shorthand for "doesn't care about privacy or security"](/2018/3/zucked-over), and who had a massive data breach as recently as [this month](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html), somehow got it into their heads that we should let them [put a camera in our homes](https://portal.facebook.com).

I'm as techno-optimist as anyone. I use Google services and have some smart devices, but this nonsense? **Hard pass**.
