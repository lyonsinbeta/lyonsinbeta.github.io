>While Apple is fighting the FBI in court over encryption, Amazon quietly disabled the option to use encryption to protect data on its Android-powered devices.

To be fair, they actually did this last Fall but the current climate, and slow roll out to of the update to older devices, is making this into big news **as it should be.**

For a company that thrives on providing such convenience to their customers this is the wrong direction to go. If users weren't turning encryption on _Amazon should turn it on by default for everyone_ not disabled it completely.
