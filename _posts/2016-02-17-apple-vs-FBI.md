>The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.

No matter what you think of Apple, their products, their services, etc. they are undeniably doing the right thing for _everyone_ by making this encryption battle very public, and very pro-encryption.

Ask any security expert and they will tell you there is no such thing as a backdoor "only good guys can use."

Google? Amazon? Microsoft? The ball is in your court. I know you all hate each other but *this is a cause worth siding with Tim Cook and Apple on.*
