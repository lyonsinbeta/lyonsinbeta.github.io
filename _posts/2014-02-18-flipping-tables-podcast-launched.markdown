When you've got a lot of projects going on what's the smartest thing you can do? _Add another project_, of course! So I did, and it's a podcast.

<!--more-->

I do so love to talk. It's particularly fun to debate geeky topics near and dear to my heart like gaming, movies, and technology, chiefly because there typically isn't a _right_ answer. My friend and colleague, [Michael Edwards](http://pseudomichael.com/), suggested we do a podcast some months ago but I dragged my feet until recently. <del>He told me to stop being a lazy ass</del> We finally decided to just go for it and the [Flipping Tables Podcast](http://flippingtablespodcast.com) was launched!

If you're into tech, gaming, culture, and (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻, then [go have a listen](http://flippingtablespodcast.com) and [subscribe in your favorite podcatcher](http://feeds.feedburner.com/flippingtablespodcast/yFdT).
