I've (begrudgingly) been a Comcast customer for a long time and I have outages roughly one per month or more. So do [a lot of other people](https://twitter.com/hashtag/comcastoutage). So it's pretty tone deaf of Comcast to tweet this:

![@Xfinity on twitter: "Google Fiber whiffs. Outage caused Kansas City customers to miss part of World Series game. Outage cause unclear."](/post-images/comcast-google-fiber-tweet.jpg)
_Note: @xfinity has since deleted this promoted tweet._

Particularly considering the fact that [Google apologized and credit effected customers for the outage](http://www.pcmech.com/article/google-fiber-goes-down-in-kc-during-world-series-gives-customers-2-days-credit/).

We're all waiting for our checks, Comcast.
