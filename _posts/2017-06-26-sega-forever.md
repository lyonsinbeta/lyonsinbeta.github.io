[SEGA Forever](http://forever.sega.com/) was announced recently and promises to bring "every classic SEGA game" to Android and iOS for free, and even includes some cool enhancements like cloud saves and controller support. There is some beautiful irony about saying your 16-bit era games will, in fact, support controllers. There are, of course, also ads. [From Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/21/15845736/sega-forever-ios-android-free-sega-mobile-games-download):

>The big caveat is that every Sega Forever title has ads â€” such is the nature of free-to-play games, after all. To get around the ads, players can spend $1.99 to get a purer experience. (Sonic the Hedgehog is still showing as a $2.99 purchase, however, since itâ€™s the same version thatâ€™s been available on the App Store and Google Play for several years.) All Sega Forever games will be available at this price, the publisher said, and that includes those coming to the program in the future.

When I heard about this my mind _boggled_ at the possibilities. High quality emulators already exist for the 8/16/32-bit systems for mobile devices (and beyond depending on your hardware) and SEGA pretty much doesn't have to do anything except slap some ads in an emulator and ship ROMs already floating around the internet anyway. Except that's apparently _not what they did_ according to [ars technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/sega-forever-emulation-performance-problems/):

>Sega's performance issues stem from the use of a new emulator based in Unity. Older mobile versions of retro Sega games were either direct portsâ€”as in the case of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic CDâ€”or used a native emulator, instead of one passed through Unity. Players that already paid for one of the launch gamesâ€”Sonic the Hedgehog, Phantasy Star II, Comix Zone, Kid Chameleon, and Altered Beastâ€”also suffered from issues, including the inability to remove advertisements from the game.

The article goes on to highlight some possibly justifiable sour grapes from Retro Arch:

>"Sorry to all the people that are experiencing subpar performance with this Unity thing," [the RetroArch devs tweeted](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spviqt). "They could have been using RetroArch right now if they hadn't been so stubbornly insistent on demanding we relicense our entire program to something that would strip us of all our rights, on top of some other unreasonable things like not showing any branding, etc. Hell, they could have had this running on the desktop right now on top of consoles and maybe some netplay as well. Oh well..."

All of this leaves me asking: SEGA... what the hell? All you had to do was pick any of a dozen emulators and sell them to us or slap some ads in there. Cloud saves are cool (and the emulators already support controllers) but [Nostalgia Goggles](http://www.nostalgiagoggles.audio) will make people play classic games _without_ enhancements. Instead of a super slick emulator experience what you end up with is this mess:

</div>

In the 60ish seconds it took me to open the game and finish Act 1 of Green Hill Zone I got to enjoy _four ads_, two of which are video ads with countdown-to-skip timers which I'm sure generates huge numbers of mistaps.

I wanted this post to be glowing praise of SEGA for their open mindedness, willingness to adapt to the times, and clever way of generating boatloads of revenue (not to mention good will) for basically no effort. Instead I'm now lamenting the future think pieces that will explain why Sony and Microsoft never followed suit because of how spectacular a failure SEGA Forever was. And don't hold out hope for Nintendo just yet as [they seem to be continuing with their strategy for drawing from the nostalgia well](http://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic).

Luckily it's still very early days for SEGA Forever, so I haven't completely given up hope that they can turn this around and make a compelling case to the industry that the ship-ROMs-make-money business model is a valid one. Sony and Microsoft, if you're reading this you have an opportunity to Sherlock SEGA and make all your Gen 1 stuff free (with ads if you must ðŸ™„) and show them how it's done. Plenty of modern devices can handle emulation from that generation, like say the powerful PCs you both make and sell.
