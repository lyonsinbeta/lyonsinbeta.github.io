Considering how long I've been listening to podcasts and podcasting, I can't believe I've never shared a list of what I actually listen to myself. Here, in alphabetical order, are all the shows I'm currently subscribed to. I've listen to many others, but I purge shows that end or I grow impossibly weary of. _I'm looking at you Welcome to Nightvale._

My podcatcher of choice for getting all these lovely shows into my earholes is still [Pocketcasts](https://pocketcasts.com) because it's the best, has Android, iOS, and web apps, and is also is the best. Like any sensible person I've worked up to listening at 1.5x and now when I hear _Wait Wait..._ on the radio at normal speed everyone sounds drunk.

I was, until recently, a masochistic completionist who actually listened to every episode of every show until I realized just how dumb that is. A combination of accelerated playback speed, purging shows I had stopped enjoying, and skipping an episode I am not interested in has made keeping up with this lengthy list possible.
