There are a laundry list of reasons laptops are better devices for the classroom than iPads, but despite that iPads have been "a thing" in education since they were introduced. Apparently [schools in Maine have finally woken up from the fever dream](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/23/apple-replace-ipads-macbooks-classrooms/) and will be swapping their iPads for Macbooks.

The first line of the article is the most revelatory (emphasis added):

> **Apple** and the Maine Department of Education have offered to swap school iPads for MacBooks **at no additional cost**, after it emerged that students and teachers overwhelmingly favor the use of laptops in class.

_Apple_ is helping them make this change _at no additional cost?_ When does Apple do _anything_ at no additional cost? That's very telling.
