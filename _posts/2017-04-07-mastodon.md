Everyone is talking about the _ugh_ "Twitter Killer" [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) and many are predictably seizing on the wrong thing. Mostly that it is a Twitter killer, which it might be but probably isn't, and isn't really the point. The point of Mastodon, and more broadly GNU Social, is that _Twitter-like_ communication needs to be standardized and federated and not owned by a single company. From _Robek.World_:

>Mastodon Social is the name of an instance on [GNU Social](https://robek.world/videos/gnusocial-video/) which uses the OStatus protocol to connect to a vast variety of servers in what‚Äôs known as a federation. Mastodon is also the name of the software being used on that server, which was developed by Eugen ‚ÄúGargron‚Äù Rochko. It was built with Ruby on Rails, Redux, and React.js. I learned the latter from the Wikipedia page, which is about the extent of research given by any of the other articles published this week.

If history is any indicator this whole Mastodon thing won't last long but I really hope it, or at least what it represents, survives. In the meantime I'm trying to help it survive by being part of the community.

Update 2017-07-07: I'm [@lyonsinbeta@mastodon.xyz](https://mastodon.xyz/@lyonsinbeta) now because mastodon.network went down with no indication the admin will be fixing it. That can happen in a federated network. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
