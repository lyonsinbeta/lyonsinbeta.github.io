>"Itâ€™s hard to be a fan of Twitter right now. The company is [sticking up](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/twitter-alex-jones-7-day-ban/) for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, when nearly all other platforms have [given him the boot](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/all-the-platforms-that-have-banned-infowars/), itâ€™s overrun with bots, and now itâ€™s breaking usersâ€™ favorite third-party Twitter clients like [Tweetbot and Twitterific](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/tweetbot-loses-several-key-features-ahead-of-twitters-api-change/) by shutting off APIs these apps relied on. Worse still, is that Twitter isnâ€™t taking full responsibility for its decisions."

>"Maybe itâ€™s time to close the apps â€“ third-party and otherwise. Maybe itâ€™s time to go dark. Get off the feeds. Take a break. Move on."

Twitter doesn't need to be perfect to be useful, but they're trying so. hard. to be useless, and worse; harmful. ðŸ’”

Also a friendly reminder that the hashtag, [#breakingmytwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/breakingmytwitter?src=hash), some users are rallying around is only possible because of [someone else's good idea, not Twitter's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag#Origin_and_use).
