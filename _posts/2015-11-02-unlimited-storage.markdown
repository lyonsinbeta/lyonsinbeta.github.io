We need to get out of the habit of calling things "unlimited" that obviously aren't. When Flickr gave itself a makeover they announced "1 Terabyte of storage" which in my opinion is a _better_ headline than "Unlimited storage" because 1TB actually means something and unlimited obviously doesn't.

Microsoft previously announced unlimited storage for O365 subscribers and [has since had to renege](https://blog.onedrive.com/onedrive_changes/) when a user [hilariously abused the unlimited storage](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-reneges-on-unlimited-onedrive-storage-promise-for-office-365-subscribers/). It's not really abuse though, is it? You said "unlimited", Microsoft, and now you're upset that someone was foolish enough to take you at your word. There's more than a few ways this situation could have been handled more delicately and I have a way to prevent it from ever happening again; _stop calling things unlimited._

There are always limits, and companies having to take ownership of those limits means consumers can actually make informed decisions. Storage, bandwidth, etc., we all know these things have a cost, so let's just be upfront about that reality and have a little transparency.

And don't think I've forgotten about you, wireless carriers. If you want to avoid press like this
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft gets pissed at user with a 76 terabyte OneDrive, downgrades everyone to 1TB max, nerfs free tier to 5GB <a href="https://t.co/tpLCGGy7nD">https://t.co/tpLCGGy7nD</a></p>&mdash; SecuriTay (@SwiftOnSecurity) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/661403648723816449">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But seriously, props to the user who figured out how to get the OneDrive client to work long enough to upload 76 TERABYTES of data.</p>&mdash; SecuriTay (@SwiftOnSecurity) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/661404298232795140">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote>

you're going to have to be honest about what your costs are, and what we're getting for our money.
