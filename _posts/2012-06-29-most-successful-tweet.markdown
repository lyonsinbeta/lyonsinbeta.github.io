As of the time of this writing my [most successful tweet](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/218399705791602688) is one where I admitted a stupid mistake I made that was apparently quite relatedable. It's been retweeted over 20 times earned a handful of favorites, and even started a few nice conversations. I think I may have even gained a follower or two.

To be fair, it only got *that* attention because a certain [Jeff](https://twitter.com/codinghorror
) retweeted it.

Be that as it may, it was still nice to see that all of the replies and reactions were people who shared similar experiences. No negativity, just empathy. It seems doubly approproaite when you consider Stack Exchange is all about saying "I don't know how to do this!" and strangers coming together to say "Here's how!"

If you're curious; [this was the stackoverflow post in question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10079148/savon-returning-xml-as-string-not-hash).
