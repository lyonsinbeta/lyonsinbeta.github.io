_Author's Note: This post isn't prescriptive. I'm not telling you what to do or how to do it, rather this is just a bit of sharing my experience. You do you._

I subscribe to a _lot_ of stuff. For a while now I've been thinking maybe too much. A few months ago I went on a massive purge to make sure the things I pay attention to are worthy of my attention whenever possible. And yes, I consider being entertained a valid place to put some of my attention; anyone who tells you 100% of your time can be productive, educational, or "crushing it" might as well be wearing a shirt that says "If I'm not burned out now I will be soon!"

The error I made during the great purge of 2017 is that I filtered for just quality, which still left me with a lot of stuff and worse, a lot of duplication. So I looked at my various  attention blackholes and asked how I could quiet them without sacrificing quality of content. The places I looked are:

- Podcasts
- Twitter
- ~~Feedly~~
- ~~Pocket~~ er... ~~Instapaper~~ eh, Pocket

## Podcasts

This one was the hardest, and no question where I suffered from the most FOMO. I love podcasts. I host a show, [Nostalgia Goggles](http://nostalgiagoggles.audio), and produce two others, [Eclectic Readers](http://eclecticreaders.fireside.fm) and [Movie Medicine](http://moviemedicinepodcast.com), so turning my back on some of the very shows and hosts that got me into podcasting felt like a betrayal. But really do I really need _six_ podcasts that cover general tech news? At two hours each?! No I super do not. I asked myself which shows and _hosts_ had the most valuable and interesting views and weren't just reporting the news. I know the iPhone X (pronounced "X") was released. I don't need to be told that by six different panels of bloggers.

From that angle I was able to easily part with _hours_ of weekly obligation. I was worried about what I might be missing for about two weeks and now I can't even remember a couple of the shows I gave up. And it's not that they were bad, quite the opposite, it's just that the subjects that interest me have no shortage of voices so I could be picky about which voices I wanted to lend my ears to.
