HBO Now, HBO's admission that most people don't want cable, launched as an iOS exclusive 3 months ago. If you don't have an iOS device, and weren't sneaky enough to use a friend's to setup your account then watch on a laptop, you've been sadly waiting all this time. But the wait is over! HBO Now is [available on Google Play now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hbo.hbonow) and it's a really kind of pathetic port.

Unlike it's older sibling, HBO Go, HBO Now on android doesn't have Chromecast support, and for some reason blocks anyone with a rooted device from _even installing it._

The reviews are already pouring in, and they are not happy.

Get it together HBO.
