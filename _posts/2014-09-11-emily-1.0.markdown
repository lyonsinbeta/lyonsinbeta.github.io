After nine months of planning, and 12 months of work, Susan and I are proud to announce Emily 1.0! It's been a long road getting here, but with the support of family, friends, and a great community we've been able to take our idea and turn it into something really great. I've posted the changelog below so you can relive the journey with us.

**Thanks for an incredible year!** We're looking forward to many, many more to come!
