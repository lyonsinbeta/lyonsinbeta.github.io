[Senator Ted Cruz took to twitter this morning to prove he has no idea how the internet works.](https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/531834493922189313)

> "Net Neutrality" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.

You know that whole "free market" thing republicans are constantly hearlding as the right way to run the economy? Net neutrality is what makes that possible on the internet. Crapping on it just because a President you don't like supports it doesn't just make you appear childish and petty, it _proves you are childish and petty_.
