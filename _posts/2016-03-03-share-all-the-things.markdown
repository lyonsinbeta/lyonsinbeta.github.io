You can read any number of blogs and think pieces about the benefits of sharing what you're working on and learning. I work in technology in the education sector, and between those two groups of people there are a seemingly unlimited number of voices telling me to share more of what I'm working on, learning, and most importantly, _struggling with._

Most people seem to have no problem going on twitter or Facebook and complaining about a problem they're having, but a blog post tends to command a little more thought, reflection, and often a solution.

**This post** is a reminder to myself, and to you, that you can share what you're working on and your victories, but don't forget to share your struggles, _particularly when you don't have a solution._ [Nothing will get your brain moving quite like explaining the issue you're having even if no one is listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). And even if you don't have a solution by the end of your post you still have spent quality time reflecting on the problem, and by sharing your struggle you just might reassure someone in a similar position.
