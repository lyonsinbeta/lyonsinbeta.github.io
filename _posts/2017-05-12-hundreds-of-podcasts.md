_I've been meaning to write about this since before [Sunrise Robot shut down](http://sunriserobot.net/blog/sunset-robot/) but it's just as relevant now, and better late than never._

When Mike and I first started Flipping Tables and published episode `000` (why did I name them like that?!) it struck a stark contrast against some of the podcasts I listened to that had episodes totaling close to four digits. I genuinely wondered how we would ever get there from here. Turns out when you make your art week after week for years you end up with a lot of art. Flipping Tables ran for three years, and our other shows ran for the two years that Sunrise Robot was active, so how did the numbers stack up?

- 150 episodes of [Flipping Tables](http://sunriserobot.net/flippingtables)
- 70 episodes of [Bits & Pieces](http://sunriserobot.net/bitsandpieces)
- 44 episodes of [Likely Story](http://sunriserobot.net/likelystory)
- 31 episodes of [Eclectic Readers Book Club](http://sunriserobot.net/eclecticreaders) (which [is still running](http://eclecticreaders.fireside.fm/) and you should go subscribe!)
- 31 episodes of [The Pseudo Show](http://sunriserobot.net/pseudoshow)
- 19 episodes of [Some Pulp](http://sunriserobot.net/somepulp)

**345 episodes** our small team produced in three years. And that's a big number _if_ taken all at once, but averaged out it's only 2.2 episodes/week. For "two people talking" style podcasts like the ones on Sunrise Robot that's a really managable amount of work session by session that only seems unmanageable in aggregate. It can suck [starting over with episode `1`](http://nostalgiagoggles.aduio)(fool me once!) but I've made hundreds of podcasts before and if I want to I can do it again.
