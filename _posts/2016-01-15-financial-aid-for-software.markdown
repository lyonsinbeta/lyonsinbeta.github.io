>Rules for [federal aid eligibility](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=0900b7322acc5a5a10c558b8fe15ad7b&rgn=div8&view=text&node=34:3.1.3.1.1.1.23.2&idno=34) require “regular and substantive interaction” between students and instructors in distance education programs. That requirement does not apply to correspondence courses. Students typically initiate contact with their instructors in those courses, which often are self-paced.

I wonder what will happen once we finally nail adaptive learning and the "instructor" is software?
