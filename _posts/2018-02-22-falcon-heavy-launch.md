It's pretty typical for people in the tech industry to complain about technology (and I get the difference between _complaining_ and _criticism_) but I think it's healthy to step back sometimes and marvel a little bit. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch was such an opportunity for me.

- Not _just_ because it was incredible to behold
- Not _just_ because space is wondrous and important to humanity
- Not _just_ because two of the boosters gently landed in near perfect synchronization (and upright!)

_Though I will never get tired of watching that._

No, to me the most marvelous part of it all was that I happened to be with my wife and we were able to watch the whole thing live **from my phone while flying in a plane.** People in the sky, using their magic glass rectangles, to watch synchronized rocket landings that sent a Tesla to Mars.

Pretty. Damn. Cool.
