Today Apple released a new keyboard, trackpad, and [magic mouse](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02/magic-mouse-2). They all have internal batteries, recharge via lightning cable, and the trackpad and keyboard have been improved over the already excellent previous models.

The Magic Mouse 2, however, is actually worse. They fixed none of the original issues around terrible ergonomics and an unpleasant click area, and they _added_ two new drawbacks; it doesn't have 3D Touch (the Magic Trackpad 2 does) and you can't use it while charging because the port is on the _bottom._

We get it Apple, you hate mice. You're all in on the trackpad. That's fine. You make excellent trackpads. Maybe just give up on the mouse altogether. [They are clearly not your strong suit anyway.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_USB_Mouse)
