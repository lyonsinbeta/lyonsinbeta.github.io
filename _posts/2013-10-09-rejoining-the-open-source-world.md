After entirely too long since my last `git commit -m "Initial Commit"` I've finally rejoined the OSS community!

<!--more-->

I've dabbled with code for several years now but it's not something I do full time, or even for pay (directly.) Oddly, I actually am fulfilling the dream of every teach-yourself-to-code startup and using code not to become rich and famous, but to make my life easier. I make little scripts here and there to make myself or my colleagues more efficient, but I don't write what most developers would consider "real software".

Being the wannabe that I am, I tend to follow the culture and was recently inspired by [this article](http://cubiq.org/open-source-made-me-the-man-i-am), and to that end I've [published my first bit of code in ages on Github](https://github.com/lyonsinbeta/canvas-tools). It's not much, but it makes my life and my coworker's lives a lot better.

Unfortunately, since I wasn't practicing good git fu and living the open source life, only this most recent version exists; my journey to this point is uncharted. That is a mistake I won't be making anymore!
