As that tweet says, I tried a [100 Days of X](http://100daysofx.com/) challenge, specifically for design. I spent way more than 100 days on it but I _did_ finish and it felt like a productive experiment. Having that little extra nudge to think about design in products, services, and everyday objects around me really helped focus my thoughts on how things are designed, and to try to deconstruct _why_ they might be designed that way.
