Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm David Lyons, an educational technologist, podcaster, speaker, and occasional kung fu practitioner.

Currently working as a Senior Solutions Engineer at [Instructure](https://instructure.com).

I host and produce [Nostalgia Goggles](http://nostalgiagoggles.audio), a podcast where my best friend and I replay the games of our childhood to see if they're as good as we remember. I also produce [Eclectic Readers Book Club](https://eclecticreaders.fireside.fm/), a monthly book club podcast that reads an eclectic variety of books and discusses them, and [Movie Medicine](http://www.moviemedicinepodcast.com), a podcast that explores how Hollywood portrays injury and illness in horror, action, and video game movies. If you would like to support these shows you can slide on in to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lyonsinbeta).

I also founded the podcast network [Sunrise Robot](https://sunriserobot.net) (now retired) with [Michael Edwards](https://pseudomichael.com/) which is still available as an archive if you want to hear me on [Flipping Tables](https://sunriserobot.net/flippingtables).
