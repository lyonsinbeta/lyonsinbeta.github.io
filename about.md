<p>I've has been working in academic technology since 2006 and have served at four different institutions of higher education. Currently at the University of Colorado Denver, I love to work with, write, and talk about technology. I'm also a vocal proponent of change in the higher-ed sector.</p>

<p>When not behind a keyboard I can be found behind a controller, hiking or practicing Kung fu.</p>
