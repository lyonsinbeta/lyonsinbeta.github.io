        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Almost every day I witness security atrocities: weak passwords, using the same password on every site, unlocked smartphones, unprotected wifi, people walking away from unlocked computers, and one of the worst of all, <em>sharing passwords</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/share-password-get-slapped.gif" alt="Share passwords, get slapped.">
<em>This is what I imagine doing every time someone tells me they gave someone else  their password.</em></p>

<p>Why should you care about having strong and unique passwords? A different big site seems to get hacked just about every week, and if you&#39;re using the same username and password all over then the bad guys can get into all of your other accounts. And if you&#39;re thinking you don&#39;t care about your online accounts think of these two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>the damage someone can do if they can &quot;be&quot; you on social networking and other public forums is very serious</li>
<li>if bad guys get into your email they basically own you because they can now reset passwords to other things... like your bank</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no denying it; as security increases, usability decreases. Until we have some sort of un-fakable way of identifying a person we&#39;ll probably keep using the username/password combo, and as long as we have usernames and passwords people will use <code>password</code> or <code>fido1</code> and other crappy guessables. (Sorry to all the people whose passwords I just posted.)</p>

<p>Fortunately password managers are a thing, and they&#39;re dirt cheap and pretty simple. I use <a href="https://lastpass.com">LastPass</a> myself because it works everywhere. Recently I went through the Security Check they offer and I was repulsed by my results. I had duplicates! And weak passwords! <strong>Unacceptable!</strong></p>

<p>It took the better part of a day (no reason it had to be done all at once, but hey), and I brought my security score from 65% to 88%! Why not higher? Sadly some organizations are still stuck in the 90s and have a short maximum length to their passwords, or they don&#39;t allow special characters, or some other ridiculous set of rules that compromises security. Also, a couple of accounts are still being upgraded because they had other issues that had to be resolved first. Finally, I have to maintain a few passwords for other people&#39;s accounts (!!) for work, and their passwords suck, so I get punished for it in the audit.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/security-score.png" alt="65% all the way up to 88% in one day"></p>

<p>One of the biggest wins was actually killing off tons of old accounts. That 65% score was for over 220 accounts, and the 88% is only 171. Whenever I came across an account I didn&#39;t want anymore I closed it instead of improving its password. Sorry some random website I commented on 6 years ago, I don&#39;t need an account anymore. A surprising caveat to this is that most forums apparently <em>do not</em> let you delete your account so they can maintain the integrity of your posts <strong>even if you never posted</strong> (remember when you needed an account just to search a forum?) In these cases I just made my password super strong and resigned myself to otherwise forget about it forever. Another surprising thing was how often people on these forums said &quot;Why delete your account? Why don&#39;t you just never come back?&quot; To which I say &quot;How about you just delete my damn account since I&#39;m never coming back?&quot; I did not expect this indifference towards orphaned accounts.</p>

<p>The long and short of it is that using a password manager makes having <strong>strong</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>unique</strong> passwords trivial. Two-factor auth, and device encryption are also awesome (and I&#39;ll post about them later), but you can vastly improve your situation just by making your passwords not suck. There are no <em>valid</em> excuses. Use <a href="https://lastpass.com">LastPass</a>, use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1password</a>, use <a href="http://www.roboform.com/">RoboForm</a>, but use <em>something</em>.</p>
