        <h1 class="post-title">The LMS Grade Book Isn't Complicated, You Are!</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Over the years I have seen thousands of course grade books and a <em>disturbing quantity</em> have <strong>glaring errors.</strong> This phenomenon isn&#39;t limited to a specific institution or LMS. Some of them are misuses of the tool, some of them are misunderstandings, and a lot of them are just negligence. The scary part is that this means tens of thousands of inaccurate grades are reported every semester.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/davidpaullyons/common-pitfalls-of-the-sakai-gradebook">I gave a talk at Jasig Sakai 2012</a> about common pitfalls of the grade book but a more accurate title would have been <em>&quot;You Suck At Grading And You&#39;re Terrible For Not Caring More&quot;</em>, though that talk would have had a harder time getting accepted. The reality of the situation is the grade book tools in all the various LMSs I&#39;ve used are not that complicated, but instructors make them complicated. Here are some poor decisions I see frequently:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Grading with fractions of points instead of integers</li>
<li>  Using percentages instead of points (or worse, percentages OF percentages)</li>
<li>  Monolithic lists of undifferentiated items</li>
<li>  Overly complicated grading schemes (there are 147 quizzes but I just take the highest 32, then I curve against the 2nd best and 13th worst students)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another title for that talk could have been <em>&quot;You&#39;re Not As Good At Math As You Think&quot;</em>. It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t make these weird grading methods work, but <strong>why should you?</strong> What benefit is there to having a wildly complicated grading scheme? It&#39;s more error prone, it&#39;s more difficult for your students to understand, and it&#39;s <strong><em>way more error prone because you are not as good at math as you think.</em></strong></p>

<p>Want to eliminate most errors from your grade book in just a few easy steps?</p>

<ol>
<li> Grade with points (not fractions of a point, and not percentages, letters, or anything else)</li>
<li> Check two students final grade by hand calculation (if it&#39;s different than your grade book, check again, then ask someone for help. If it&#39;s too complicated to check by hand <em>that&#39;s a sign that it&#39;s too damn complicated!</em>)</li>
<li> Chant over and over to yourself that a dash in the grade book is not the same as a zero. You need to zero out unsubmitted work to accurately reflect a student&#39;s final grade</li>
<li> Seriously, do not ignore step three. That error alone is responsible for a mountain of inaccurate final grades</li>
</ol>

<p>Please don&#39;t be afraid to ask your colleagues, your instructional designers, or your technical support, for assistance. Assigning a letter to something as ethereal as &quot;learning&quot; is already kind of spurious; let&#39;s at least assign the correct letters.</p>
